Prior to setting up ONTO, Rob worked for 5 years at Jaguar Land Rover. Initially, taking the concept of an electric vehicle subscription service to JLRâ€™s in-house business incubator was quickly recognised as having significant limitations as a JLR captive company.

Rob was given approval to develop the idea outside of JLR, and left to form ONTO in 2017. They offer all-inclusive electric vehicle subscriptions on a monthly rolling contract, providing all the benefits of car ownership with none of the hassle.
