title: "We funded Lemonade Dolls"

Lemon, the founder, performer and coach, started the business as a community on Instagram with like minded girls who inspire, support and motivate each other to live their dream life. Her following increased rapidly, and as the response was so positive, it led her to create a business. After countless hours of market research and understanding the huge gap in the underwear market, Lemon couldn’t let this opportunity pass her by.

Lemonade Dolls is the UK’s first underwear subscription business that represents a new generation of young women and is all about female empowerment. Lemon and her team design, manufacture and sell a new brand of underwear, because lingerie isn’t just about pleasing men anymore. These women want hassle-free, positive, comfy underwear to help them take over the world.
