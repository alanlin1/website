Even in 2023, female founders continue to face challenges in accessing opportunities and funding. For instance, across Europe as a whole, female founders have secured just 1.3 per cent of all venture capital funding available since 2017.

Outfund provides non-dilutive funding to founders across the globe, and our data-driven approach removes the bias from traditional decision-making. Since 2020, we’ve strived to democratise access to funding and, to date, we’ve provided over £10m to women-led businesses.

To celebrate International Women’s Day, we’re sharing the stories of some of our female founders to help inspire the next wave of great businesses.

Colchón Morfeo is a Sapinish based matress brand. We’re thrilled to introduce the founder, Elena Fernández Sánchez to share her story…

We founded Morfeo in 2017 with the idea of changing and improving the way people sleep. Sleep has a huge impact on our well-being; we spend one-third of our life sleeping, so we thought it was time to see what makes us sleep better, and how we could improve it. Better sleep means better energy, giving us all a better chance of accomplishing what we want. 

We’ve bootstrapped the business to date, which, though challenging, hasn’t held us back from making a high-quality product which customers love. Only 6% of customers return the beds and mattresses they’ve bought from us. I’m so proud of the brand we have built in the Spanish market, underpinned by the strength of our products. 

In the future, we’re working hard on launching our products in specialist retailers, in the hope of accessing even more customers via an increased physical presence.
