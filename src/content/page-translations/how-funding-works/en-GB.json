        "question": "How do you calculate my offer?",
        "answer": "Outfund securely connects to your existing banking, payment processing, and accounting platforms. Using predictive models, we assess key metrics from your revenue, ad performance and other third party data to create bespoke funding offers. <br/><br/> Our funding is based on your performance. We don't take any equity, meaning we don't dilute you or your investors. Instead, funding is repaid through a simple revenue share."

        "question": "How long does the whole process take?",
        "answer": "The entire process (application, offer, approval, sending funds) can be completed in as little as two business days. Large advances and applications requiring special considerations or analysis may take slightly longer."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I apply?",
        "answer": "You can apply in minutes here. You'll need to be a director of the company you're applying for. <br/><br/> You'll need to connect your business bank account, payment processor and company financial accounts. This data will allow us to build your funding offer."
